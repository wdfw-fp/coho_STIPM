# coho_STIPM

This repository contains code modified from [daauerbach/ST-IPM](https://github.com/daauerbach/ST-IPM), itself revised from the original source in [lukasdefilippo/ST-IPM](https://github.com/lukasdefilippo/ST-IPM). [DeFilippo et al.(2021)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165783621001429) created and tested a "Spatiotemporal Integrated Population Model" (ST-IPM) of Washington state natural origin coho (*O. kisutch*) returns.

The scripts are used for annual preseason forecasting of returns of naturally spawning coho salmon in Washington state.
